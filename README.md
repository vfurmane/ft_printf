# ft_printf

This is my 3rd project at @42Paris.

:timer_clock: : 12 days

:heavy_check_mark: : 100

## Usage

This project is a library that contains only one function: `ft_printf`. To use the library, first compile it:

```shell
make all
```

Then use it by specifying these flags:

```
-L path -lftprintf
```

### Example

```shell
clang main.c -L ft_printf -lftprintf
```

## Personal Notes

This project wasn't that hard as you have to print strings, numbers, ... The hardest part was testing all the possible cases, and there are a lot.
